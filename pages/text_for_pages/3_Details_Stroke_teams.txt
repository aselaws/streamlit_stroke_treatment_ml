### Which teams are included?

Most acute stroke teams that submitted data to the SSNAP audit between the years of 2016 and 2021. In total, 119 teams are in the final decision model.

### How are they picked?

Some teams are excluded when there is not enough data available for the model to be reliable. 

### Why are teams given numbers?

Currently the team names are anonymised. We know how stroke team is labelled in the app and so can check the performance of particular teams when required.
